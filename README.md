# PlugTrack

PlugTrack is a personal web app for logging and managing **EV charging sessions** and **car profiles**.  
It is designed to be modular, extendable, and future-proof, with support for analytics, notifications, AI insights, and live charger data planned in later phases.

---

## üöó Project Goals
- Track charging sessions with accurate cost-per-session history.
- Manage car profiles, including battery size, efficiency, and recommended charging habits.
- Provide insights into cost per mile, charging efficiency, and battery health (future phases).
- Offer flexible configuration entirely through the app UI (not config files).
- Support notifications and AI-driven insights in later phases.
- Deployable as a PWA and containerised app in later phases.

---

## üì¶ Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python (Flask + SQLAlchemy ORM)
- **Database**: SQLite (migrations with Flask-Migrate)
- **Frontend**: Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5 (responsive UI)
- **Config**: `.env` for environment-level settings only
- **Security**: Sensitive data (API keys, passwords) encrypted before storage

## üîñ Project Roadmap

### Phase 1 ‚Äì Core Foundations ‚úÖ (Current)
- Modular Flask app with blueprints
- User authentication (single-user support initially)
- Car profiles with recommended charging frequency
- Charging session CRUD (with historical tariff accuracy)
- Settings page with tabs for Cars, Home Charging, Notifications*, AI Integration*
- Dashboard with active car summary + recent sessions
- Encryption support for sensitive settings

### Phase 2 ‚Äì Analytics & Insights
- Charts and trends (cost per mile, kWh efficiency, charging mix)
- Filterable dashboards
- Rule-based recommendations

### Phase 3 ‚Äì Notifications & AI
- Gotify/Apprise notifications (charge reminders, alerts)
- AI integration (OpenAI/Anthropic) for narrative summaries and insights

### Phase 4 ‚Äì PWA & Docker
- PWA support (offline mode, mobile installable)
- Docker containerisation for easy deployment

### Phase 5 ‚Äì Live Charger Data
- Integration with public charger APIs (Zap-Map or similar)
- Real-time price/availability checks
- Optimised blended charging recommendations
